## Description

This is my web developer portfolio, which I will be adding throughout my design and coding journey.

I have put into practice some skills I have learnt, including

- responsive design using CSS media queries
- CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts

## Notes

My Work Projects images all have a \<h3\> titles in the HTML, however I made most of these invisible via CSS for design purposes, as the images themslevs visually contain the website application titles, and I feel repeating these titles in the overlaid HTML uneccessary.

I point this out because I realise one of the Acceptance Criteria for this challenge, is "the section contains titled images of your applications". So they are there in the HTML for accessibility and Searchability, they are just not visible by design!
